Template::Mustache::Simple
==========================

A tiny wrapper around Template::Mustache.

This module was created to scratch an itch. And it is not well tested. I would
also prefer to see some small changes in the original module improved, rather
than have an frivolous modules added, so I'm not planning on submitting it to
CPAN until it is more clear whether it has long term value.

GOALS


- Simplify the interface
- Avoid $Template-Mustache::* package vars
- Avoid reinventing existing code where possible
